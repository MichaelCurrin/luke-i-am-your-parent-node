# Luke I Am Your Parent Node
> GraphQL wrapper for Star Wars API, written in NodeJS

Do queries for Star Wars data in the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) queries.

## Background

I attended introductory GraphQL workshop at [Codebridge](https://codebridge.org.za/). An exercise at the end was of the one section was to use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [graphql-js](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) to build a GraphQL wrapper around an existing REST API. I decided on a Star Wars API ([SWAPI](https://swapi.co/)) which I'd found before and that turned into this repo.
