> GraphQL wrapper for Star Wars API, written in NodeJS

I'm a fan of Star Wars so was delighted to discover the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), which provides a public REST API around some Star Wars content like characters, vehicles and planets. After attending an introductory GraphQL workshop, I decided to build a GraphQL endpoint based on the REST API.
